        <h2>Recreating the Team Alpha Male home page</h2>

          <p class="projectInfo">The objective of this project was
              to recreate the framework of an already existing websites home page. I chose to work with the Team Alpha Male webpage for this assignment. To the left
              you'll see a thumbnail of the mockup I created, which is basically the websites
              blueprint. If you click on it you will be able to further disect the layout and
              placement of elements. This phase in the design process determines where all the content and
              information is going to be presented.</p>

              <br>

              <p class="projectInfo">If you click on the thumbnail to the right you will be able to view the fully coded home page.
                Utilizing the mockup I created on moqups.com, I was able to code the layout of the page using
                HTML and CSS. Once I had all the frames in place, I was then able to apply all the content and images where they
                belonged in order to have the complete design of the page. For the purpose of this assignment we were
                adviced to have the page be 955 pixels in width and centered.

          <h2>Responsive Web Development</h2>
  
            <p class="projectInfo">The objective of this project was
                to create a make believe startup landing page with web responsive capabilities. HTML and CSS was used throughout the creation
                of the page as well as introductory bootstrap styling techniques. Some of the bootstrap classes that were applied on the page
              was the carousel in the testimonials section and the cards class in the pricing area. Web responsiveness was applied via the
            row and column bootstrap classes, which change the layout of page depending on the sizing of the browser or device being used.</p>

          <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
          <p>The purpose of this exercise was to gain familiarity with the use semantic elements.
          These types of elements are similar to divs but actually give meaning to different sections
        of the website code. With the use of semantic elements our code will be presented in a much more
      organized manner. Some of the elements utilized in this webpage were header, section, article, footer, nav, and aside.</p>

          <h3>Styling with Float</h3>
          <p>This assignments objective was to learn how to style images using float within our CSS.
          With the use of float we can have our websites images float to the left or to the right and have text flow around them as shown on this example.</p>

      <!--NOTES
          Common block elements
          - <p></p>
          - <h1></h1> through <h6></h6>
          - <div></div>
          - <ol></ol> <ul></ul> <li></li>
          - <form></form>

          Common inline elements
          - <span></span>
          - <img></img>
          - <a> (anchors)

          ********************** Display Properties: ***********************
          - display: inline;
          (changes the elements block display to inline and allows other elements to beside it on same line
          but you will not be able to change its width anymore)

          - display: block;
          (changes the elements inline display to block and wont allow other elements to sit beside it but
          you will be able to change the width property)

          -display: inline-block;
          (will give you the best of both worlds... the element will then be displayed on the same line as other
          elements but you will be able to still manipulate the width property)

          -display: none;
          (simply gets rid of the element from the website as if it did not exist within the page)

          -vissibility: hidden;
          (makes element dissappear but it keeps its original position and all the other elements still flow around it)

          ********** Image elements can sort of be considered "inline-block" because they can sit in the
          same line and you can manipulate the width ***********


          *********************** POSITION PROPERTIES *********************
          - position: static;
          (all html elements are static in their position by default.. by applying static you are
          positioning the element to the flow of the default html flow and rules)

          - position: relative;
          (when you move an element that has a relative position (example: relatively pushing down an
          element 50px from the top) it does not affect the position of anything else on screen as if the
          old position was kept and everythng else just flows around it as if it was never moved. Its almost
          as if the elemnt left the ghost of itself where it use to be in order for all the other elements
          to keep their own positions. It can be compared to a margin. We are taking the top from where the elemnt use
          to be and giving it a 50 pixel margin from the top of the current element) ****relative positioning only
          works when you also apply a coordinate of LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, or BOTTOM**********

          - position: absolute;
          (with absolute positioning we are positioning the element relative to its parent. Ex. if img is positioned
          right: 30px; within a div container then the img element within the div will be positioned to the right of the parent element (the div)
          with a 30px margin on the right side.) ******** with absolute positioning it does affect the flow of the html.. you take the element
          out of the flow of the document and is no longer considered part of the natural flow of the document***********

          - position: fixed;
          (the element stays fixed in its position when you scroll through the web page. You can have a fixed nav bar
          so that the when the user scrolls down the nav bar will still be visible for the user.)
